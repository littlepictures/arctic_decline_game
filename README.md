# CLIP - Arctic Decline Game

## Background on this CLIP
Arctic Decline is a little interactive game that gives an intuitive insight into the realities of the shrinking sea ice. The size of the paddles corresponds to the arctic sea ice area in the respective level / year. It is intentionally designed with a retro game character as the arctic sea ice dataset used for the game begins in the early 80s. The game was initially developed as a side project but was completely redesigned and reprogrammed for release in this project.

## Data Sources
The game is written in javascript and fetching it's level data from a 'levels.json' file. 

The sea ice extent data is derived from this source: https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2023/05/Late_summer_sea-ice_extent_in_the_Arctic
